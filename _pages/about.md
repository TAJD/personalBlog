I currently work at [Dynamon](https://dynamon.co.uk/). We develop products that make the logistics industry greener.

I've previously worked as a naval architect, sports engineer and a data scientist. If I'm not locking down then you might find me sailing.

The mistakes on this website are entirely my own but I am willing to share the blame. If you've found something useful or have a suggestion then feel free to send me an email at tajdickson at protonmail.com.

You can find me online at [Github](https://github.com/TAJD) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/thomas_dickson).
